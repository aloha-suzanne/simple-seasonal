                <h4>What to make with apples this fall</h4>
                <p>Apples are abundant this time of year.  Here are some of my favorite ways to use them: in salads with roasted vegetables, leafy greens, and cheese, baked with oats and spices for a delicious healthy dessert, and cooked with squash and then blended into a nourishing soup.</p>

                <h4>August's seasonal vegetables</h4>
                <p>In late August, there is an abundance of tomatoes, eggplant, and zucchini.  These vegetables also complement each other and can be cooked together in a variety of ways.  I love to grill them with herbs and spices or cook them on a stovetop to make a delicious ratatouille.</p>
